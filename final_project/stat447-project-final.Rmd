# Introduction
\bigskip

The FIFA World Cup will be held in Qatar in late 2022. And this competition is 
one of the grandest international contests, attracting people around the world. 
We have noticed that there is a trend that some star players’ wage is much higher 
than the average wage, and certain potential players have their wage below market 
value compared to other players, and thus resulting in the uneven situation among 
the player trading market and the basic standard of the expected value. Therefore, 
we plan to analyze what factors influence FIFA soccer players' wages. We use dataset 
from "FIFA 2022", an EA game which is an up-to-date reflecction on real world FIFA, 
to perform our analysis.

In this project, we first plot graphs of several factors that we believe would 
affect one player's wage, such as ages, league level, and overall scores, etc. 
Then, we try to train the dataset to figure out the most influential factors of 
their annual salary based on their performance data in 2022 via various methodologies 
like linear regression and lasso regression. We will mainly focus on their objective 
physial skills and try to obtain a prediction model for their wage based on these 
factors.

# Setup
\bigskip

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
## load libraries

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ISLR2)
library(glmnet)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

```
\bigskip

```{r}
## load dataset from local file location

player_general = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/illinois-stat447/fa22-prj-yutingl7-zs30-zhaolin4-yufeid3-yiy14/main/datasets/players_22.csv")
```
\bigskip

```{r}
## convert dataset into data.table or tibble for better operation

p_gen = as_tibble(player_general)
```
\bigskip

The “p_gen” dataset contains most of the personal information we need to analyze 
what factors influenced different player’s wage, including their height, age, 
potentials, etc. 
\bigskip\bigskip

\newpage

# Visualization
\bigskip

```{r}
summary(p_gen$wage_eur)
boxplot(p_gen$wage_eur)
```
\bigskip

We present a summary and a box plot of the average weekly wage. We can clearly 
see there are plenty of outliers in the boxplot. The third quartile is only €8000, 
but the max value is €350000. This is a huge difference and also represents an 
extreme income inequality. We will find out what factors caused this phenomenon.
\bigskip

```{r}
## plot weekly wage by players' age, and then analyze the factors that affect 
## their wage, such as their potential

p_gen_age = p_gen |> 
  group_by(age) |> 
  summarise(wage = mean(na.omit(wage_eur)), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(data = p_gen_age) +
  geom_point(aes(x = age, y = wage), color = "black") +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = age, y = wage), method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, 
              color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("FIFA 2021-2022 Players Average Weekly Wage by Age", 
          subtitle = "wage measured in EUR") +
  xlab("Player Age") +
  ylab("Average Weekly Wage")
```
\bigskip

We first considered age factor, so we grouped the p_gen dataset by age and calculated 
the average wage of different age region. We can clearly see from the plot that 
the average wage increases at first and reach the peak at the age around 30, and 
the wage gradually goes down as the age decreased. We can also conclude an almost 
linear relationship between age and average wage, with a higher standard error 
from 40 to 50. This may due to their potential, which is their abilities, that 
varies their wage.
\bigskip

```{r}
## plot weekly wage by players' league 
##

p_gen_lea_avg = p_gen |>
  drop_na(league_name, wage_eur, league_level) |> 
  filter(league_level == 1) |> 
  select(league_name, wage_eur) |>
  group_by(league_name) |>
  summarise(avg_wage = mean(wage_eur),
            tot_wage = sum(wage_eur),
            med_wage = median(wage_eur),
            .groups = "drop")

p_gen_lea_avg_order = tibble::rowid_to_column(p_gen_lea_avg, "index")

p_gen_lea_avg_order_filter = p_gen_lea_avg_order |> 
  filter(avg_wage >= 10000) |> 
  mutate(avg_wage = avg_wage - 1000)

ggplot(data = p_gen_lea_avg_order) +
  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = avg_wage)) +
  geom_text(data = p_gen_lea_avg_order_filter, 
            aes(x = index, y = avg_wage, label = league_name), color = "purple") +
  ggtitle("Dot Plot for Average Weekly Wage", subtitle = "wage measured by EUR") +
  xlab("League Index") +
  ylab("Average Weekly Wage")
```
\bigskip

We then focused on the top ranked clubs in league level one which could be more 
representative. We calculated average, total, and median wage for each league and 
selected the league with average wage more than €10,000. From the dot plot we have 
highlighted 9 leagues that met the criteria, and these leagues will be the main 
target for our analysis. 
\bigskip

```{r}
ggplot(data = p_gen_lea_avg_order) +
  geom_density(aes(x = avg_wage), color = "purple") +
  ggtitle("Density Plot for Average Weekly Wage", subtitle = "wage measured in EUR") +
  xlab("Average Weekly Wage")
```
\bigskip

The density plot shows that there is a huge proportion of leagues with average 
weekly wage less than €10,000. There are three little peaks in €20,000, €30,000, 
and €50,000, corresponding to the highlighted leagues in the dot plot.
\bigskip

```{r}
# international reputation

p_int = p_gen |> 
  drop_na(international_reputation) |> 
  group_by(international_reputation) |> 
  summarise(avg_wage = round(mean(na.omit(wage_eur)), digits = 2), .groups = "drop") |> 
  mutate(index = avg_wage + 5000)

ggplot(data = p_int) +
  geom_col(aes(x = international_reputation, 
               y = avg_wage, 
               fill = international_reputation), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(x = international_reputation, 
                y = index, 
                label = avg_wage, 
                color = international_reputation))
```
\bigskip

This plot shows player with higher international reputation will have higher 
average wage.
\bigskip

```{r}
# wage by overall and potential 

p_overall = p_gen |> 
  drop_na(overall, wage_eur) |> 
  mutate(wage = wage_eur / 1000) |> 
  select(overall, wage)

ggplot(data = p_overall) +
  geom_point(aes(x = overall, y = wage)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = overall, y = wage), method = "loess", formula = y ~ x)

p_potential = p_gen |> 
  drop_na(potential, wage_eur) |> 
  mutate(wage = wage_eur / 1000) |> 
  select(potential, wage)

ggplot(data = p_potential) +
  geom_point(aes(x = potential, y = wage)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = potential, y = wage), method = "loess", formula = y ~ x)
```
\bigskip

These two plots measure the overall performance and the potential of players, 
and it indicates the average weekly wage increases as the player performed better. 
We can conclude that average weekly wage has a positive relationship with player’s 
overall performance and their potential.
\bigskip

\newpage

# Prediction
\bigskip

After plotting the data, we began focus on the relationship between the players’ 
weekly wage and skills in different positions. We divided different positions into 
two groups: goalkeepers and non-goalkeepers. And for non-goalkeepers, we divided 
them into forward, midfield, and defender based on their position. 
\bigskip

## Linear Regression
\bigskip

We first conducted linear regression model for different positions.
\bigskip

For goalkeepers, we selected skills that are related with goalkeepers, such as 
goalkeeping handling and positioning, and conducted linear regression. We split 
the dataset into two parts: training dataset and testing dataset. We used our 
training dataset to obtain regression model and apply the model to our testing 
dataset to see the test error rate. 

\bigskip

```{r}
#players that are GOAL KEEPER

p_gk = p_gen |>
  filter(club_position == "GK") |>
  select(9,12,73:78)|>
  na.omit()

set.seed(42)
train_gk = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), nrow(p_gk), rep = TRUE)
test_gk = (!train_gk)
gk.train = p_gk[train_gk, ]
gk.test = p_gk[test_gk, ]

lm.fit_gk = lm(wage_eur~., data = gk.train)
lm.pred_gk = predict(lm.fit_gk, gk.test, type = "response")
summary(lm.fit_gk)

mean((lm.pred_gk - gk.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

```
\bigskip

We applied the same process for forward, midfield, and defender and obtained their 
linear regression model.
\bigskip

```{r}
#players that are FORWARD

p_f = p_gen |>
  filter(club_position %in% c("ST", "CF", "RS", "LS", "RF", "LF", "RW", "LW")) |> 
  select(9, 12, 44:72) |> 
  na.omit()

set.seed(42)
train_f = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), nrow(p_f), rep = TRUE)
test_f = (!train_f)
f.train = p_f[train_f, ]
f.test = p_f[test_f, ]

lm.fit_f = lm(wage_eur~., data = f.train)
lm.pred_f = predict(lm.fit_f, f.test, type = "response")
summary(lm.fit_f)

mean((lm.pred_f - f.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

```
\bigskip


```{r}
#players that are MIDFIELD
p_m = p_gen |> 
  filter(club_position %in% c("RCM", "CDM", "RDM", "LCM", "CAM", "LDM", "LM", 
                              "RM", "CM", "LAM", "RAM")) |> 
  select(9, 12, 44:72) |> 
  na.omit()

set.seed(42)
train_m = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), nrow(p_m), rep = TRUE)
test_m = (!train_m)
m.train = p_m[train_m, ]
m.test = p_m[test_m, ]

lm.fit_m = lm(wage_eur~., data = m.train)
lm.pred_m = predict(lm.fit_m, m.test, type = "response")
summary(lm.fit_m)

mean((lm.pred_m - m.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

```
\bigskip


```{r}
#players that are DEFENDER

p_d = p_gen |> 
  filter(club_position %in% c("LCB", "RCB", "LB", "RB", "CB", "RWB", "LWB")) |> 
  select(9, 12, 44:72) |> 
  na.omit()

set.seed(42)
train_d = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), nrow(p_d), rep = TRUE)
test_d = (!train_d)
d.train = p_d[train_d, ]
d.test = p_d[test_d, ]

lm.fit_d = lm(wage_eur~., data = d.train)
lm.pred_d = predict(lm.fit_d, d.test, type = "response")
summary(lm.fit_d)

mean((lm.pred_d - d.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

```
\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip

## Lasso Regression

We applied the second strategy, lasso regression, to our dataset. We used the Lamda 
of cross-validation to find the best lasso model.
\bigskip

```{r}
### GK

train_gk.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = gk.train)
test_gk.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = gk.test)

set.seed(42)
cv.out_gk = cv.glmnet(train_gk.mat, gk.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
bestlam_gk = cv.out_gk$lambda.min
bestlam_gk

lasso.mod_gk = glmnet(train_gk.mat, gk.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
lasso.pred_gk = predict(lasso.mod_gk, s = bestlam_gk, newx = test_gk.mat)
mean((lasso.pred_gk - gk.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

lasso.coef_gk = predict(lasso.mod_gk, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam_gk)
length(lasso.coef_gk[lasso.coef_gk != 0])
lasso.coef_gk

```
\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip

```{r}
### F

train_f.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = f.train)
test_f.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = f.test)

lasso.pred_f = predict(lasso.mod_f, s = bestlam_f, newx = test_f.mat)
mean((lasso.pred_f - f.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

lasso.coef_f = predict(lasso.mod_f, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam_f)
length(lasso.coef_f[lasso.coef_f != 0])
lasso.coef_f

```
\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip

```{r}
### M

train_m.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = m.train)
test_m.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = m.test)

set.seed(42)
cv.out_m = cv.glmnet(train_m.mat, m.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
bestlam_m = cv.out_m$lambda.min
bestlam_m

lasso.mod_m = glmnet(train_m.mat, m.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
lasso.pred_m = predict(lasso.mod_m, s = bestlam_m, newx = test_m.mat)
mean((lasso.pred_m - m.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

lasso.coef_m = predict(lasso.mod_m, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam_m)
length(lasso.coef_m[lasso.coef_m != 0])
lasso.coef_m

```
\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip

```{r}
### D

train_d.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = d.train)
test_d.mat = model.matrix(wage_eur~., data = d.test)

set.seed(42)
cv.out_d = cv.glmnet(train_d.mat, d.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
bestlam_d = cv.out_d$lambda.min
bestlam_d

lasso.mod_d = glmnet(train_d.mat, d.train$wage_eur, alpha = 1)
lasso.pred_d = predict(lasso.mod_d, s = bestlam_d, newx = test_d.mat)
mean((lasso.pred_d - d.test$wage_eur) ^ 2)

lasso.coef_d = predict(lasso.mod_d, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam_d)
length(lasso.coef_d[lasso.coef_d != 0])
lasso.coef_d
```
\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip

# Summary

After comparing the test error rate (TRSS) of our linear regression and lasso 
regression, we decided to use lasso regression as it is a better model for our 
regression, and concluded four models for FIFA players' wage by their position 
on the court. 
\bigskip

- 1.558632e+05
\bigskip

Based on our graphs and regression models, we can conclude that soccer players 
start to grow as they enter this field and make the most money when they reach 
30. Once a player get older than 30, there is a tendency for their wage to decline 
as their physical abilities start to weaken. Besides, as a player's international 
reputation, overall, and potential socre increase, their wage increase as well.
\bigskip

We chose our lasso regression model as our final prediction model. We can use the 
models to predict a player’s wage based on their positions on the court and their 
physical ability scores. We hope our prediction can help FIFA better decide a 
player’s wage and therefore create a relatively fair market.
