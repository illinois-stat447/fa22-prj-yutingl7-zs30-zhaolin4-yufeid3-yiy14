## Project Proposal - FIFA 2022
The FIFA World Cup will be held in Qatar in late 2022. And this competition is one of the grandest international contests, attracting people around the world.  We have noticed that there is a trend that some star players’ wage is much higher than the average wage, and certain potential players have their wage below market value compared to other players, and thus resulting in the uneven situation among the player trading market and the basic standard of the expected value. Therefore, we plan to analyze what factors influence FIFA soccer players' wages. We use dataset from "FIFA 2022", an EA game which is an up-to-date reflecction on real world FIFA, to perform our analysis.  

In this project, we first plot graphs of several factors that we believe would affect one player's wage, such as ages, league level, and overall scores, etc. Then, we try to train the dataset to figure out the most influential factors of their annual salary based on their performance data in 2022 via various methodologies like linear regression and lasso regression. We will mainly focus on their objective physial skills and try to obtain a prediction model for their wage based on these factors.
