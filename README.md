## Project Proposal
The FIFA World Cup will be hold in Qatar in late 2022. And this competition is one of the grandest international contests, attracting people around the world.  We have noticed that there is a trend that some star playersâ€™ annual salary is much higher than the average wage, and certain potential players have their salary below market value compared to other players, and thus resulting in the uneven situation among the player trading market and the basic standard of the expected value. Therefore, we plan to analize what factors influence their salaries and whether they perform worthy of their price tag from 2022 to 2023 in the FIFA league.

In this project, we try to train the dataset to figure out the most influential factors, such as positions, clubs, and ages, of their annual salary based on their performance data in 2022 via various methodologies like subset selection, linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, etc. As a result, we will combine several data sets and develop the models from the training dataset to get corresponding outcomes based on the inputs as a recommended solution or interpretation for this promise research field of sports management.
