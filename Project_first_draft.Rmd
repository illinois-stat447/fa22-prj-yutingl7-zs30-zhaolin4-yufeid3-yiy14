```{r}
players_data = read.csv("2021-2022 Football Player Stats.csv", sep = ";")
players = read.csv("/Users/zeanli/Desktop/players_22.csv")
p_data = as_tibble(players_data)

full_data = p_data |> 
  inner_join(players, by = c("Player" = "long_name")) |> 
  group_by(Pos) |> 
  summarise(wage = mean(wage_eur))

ggplot(data = full_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = Pos, y = wage, fill = Pos)) +
  ggtitle("FIFA 2021-2022 players average weekly wage by position")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
